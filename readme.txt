# Zig Cache - A Proof-of-Concept Cache Server

This project is a proof-of-concept cache server, written in the Zig programming language. It is inspired by distributed cache systems like Redis.

## Current Status

The project is currently in a very early stage of development. The foundational structure is being laid out, and core functionalities are yet to be implemented.

## Project Goals

The primary goal is to explore the capabilities of Zig for building high-performance network applications like a cache server.

Potential features and future goals include:
- Basic cache operations: GET, SET, DELETE
- In-memory data storage
- Simple network interface to interact with the cache
- Exploring Zig's concurrency features for handling multiple client connections (future)

## Contributions

As this is a proof-of-concept and in early development, contributions are welcome, especially in the areas of:
- Zig best practices
- Network programming in Zig
- Cache system design
